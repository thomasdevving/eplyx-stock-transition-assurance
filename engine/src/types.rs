//! The fixture format: a self-contained description of "this exact state, this
//! exact transaction".

//! This is the format the whole system is built around. Everything downstream -

//! writes these structures, so it is deliberately engine-agnostic: no litesvm
//! types appear here, and addresses are plain base58 strings.
